# CPSC335Project1

This is a solution for the Hamilotnian problem given in project 1. 
The algorithm used is the greedy algorithm. 
This solution has implemented already initialized arrays for testing purposes. Feel free to edit or change anything for further testing. 
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) and is proven using step counts. 
This program uses C++ and was created on a Macbook Pro. 

To execute this program, in a terminal input the commands
  clang++ Greedy.cpp -o main
  ./main
After this, the program should return the index of the starting city that passes the requirements.
